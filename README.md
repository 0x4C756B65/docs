# Introduction to Dune Analytics

### **The Problem**

**Aggregating Data from Blockchains is hard.**

In public blockchains such as Ethereum, all the information is inherently public. But all the data in the world does not help you make meaningful decisions without useful tooling and aggregation of the data.  
Data on the Ethereum Blockchain especially has become increasingly difficult to work with. Most of the time you are no longer dealing with simple tx that involve on contract, but rather moving pieces of a giant interconnected system. Dealing with the complexity of this data requires a toolkit that is made for this purpose specifically and can lead to great results with a bit of time.

### **The solution**

**Querying for Data on Dune is easy.**

Dune Analytics is a tool that greatly simplifies the process of querying lots of data on public blockchains. We built a web-based platform for querying Ethereum data by using simple SQL queries, from pre-populated databases.   
Instead of having to write specialized scripts, one can simply query the database to extract almost any information that resides on the blockchain. If that wasn't enough already to convince you to build on Dune, we are also working hard to make the data as accessible as possible by using custom data structures we employ on our database to make it as easy as possible for you to work with the data.

## How Dune works

Dune consists of 3 main parts that you can use: Queries, Visualizations and Dashboards. 

**Queries** are used to find data from the Blockchain. You can find out more about this in this section \(LINK\)

**Visualizations** are visual representations of the datasets\(?\) you create with your queries.

**Dashboards** are used to aggregate different Visualizations in one place in order to be able to display the relevant data all in one Place.

### Queries

At its core, Dune Analytics aggregates the raw data from blockchains into SQL databases that can be queried easily. For example, there is a table to query all Ethereum transactions. Columns cover the sender, the receiver, gas limit, gas price , etc. . To learn more about datatables please read this section\(link\).

### Visualization

Visualizations are the end product of your work. Those are the graphs and charts you want your audience to see. As always when presenting data, simpler is often times better.

### Dashboards

Dashboards are the beating heart of Dune Analytics. This is the place where people collect data on their project, data on a whole sector or just aggregate some things they may find interesting. The limits to creating cool dashboards is literally your imagination. 

You can add Text Boxes, Visualizations and links to your dashboards in a few clicks, allowing you to create the data hub for your project in just a few simple clicks.

Go and build some cool stuff.

## DUNE IS FREE, NOW AND FOREVER.

The free tier \(requires opening an account\) covers:

* Searching queries
* Writing new queries
* Creating visualizations and dashboards

All free tier queries are available for everyone to see and search. Making queries private requires a pro tier account. The pro tier offers some additional benefits, such as exporting data and hiding the watermark from graphs.
