# Raw Data

**Raw Ethereum data**

* Blocks
* Logs
* Transactions
* Receipts
* Traces

You probably won’t use this too much when doing analysis with Dune \(see [decoded data](https://hackmd.io/k71ZUSTxQVKGqOcvR6OXnw#decoded-data)\), but it’s always nice to have just in case.

You can [click here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/268/ethereum-block-architecture) to learn more about Ethereum’s data structure, but again it’s not really needed for using Dune.
